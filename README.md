# MEMORY GAME

Game created in c for university homework. A game where you choose two cards and try to get the same letter in card. If you are wrong, you can keep that in mind because if you find the letter you alreay knows where it is.

#How to play ?
 
 -1. First you need to compile the code.
	gcc memory.c memory.h main.c -o memory.exe -lm

 -2. Then you execute the code.
	./memory.exe
 
 -3. Then you watch the dialog and choose a level. ( the first one was just me messing with my teacher)


 -4. In game you first choose a letter and then choose another letter. ( or you can give both typing with a space ex: "A B")


 -5. When all cards with letters disaper you finish the game!


 Obs: The code is really a mess, but you can change and commit here. I would love to see our ideas.
